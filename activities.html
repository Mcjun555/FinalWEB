		<h1 align="center">Monthly Activities / Celebration</h1><hr>
		
			<p><b>Nutrition Month</b> - this is one of the most important activities that all schools should have. Activities that would promote health awareness would be helpful to students and teachers to reminded to take good care of their nutrition. Various classroom games, competitions, and lectures were held during this month-long celebration.<br><br>The games were conducted in clusters which were based on the grade levels of the students. All games were made sure to be health related. This is on order for students to apply what they know about nutrition. As for the competitions, it includes quiz bee, poster making, slogan making, jingle competition, and impromptu speech. The theme was obviously about nutrition.<br>

			<br><b>Fire Prevention Month</b> - this activity is a requirement for all schools in the Philippines. It is mandatory for schools to have fire evacuation plans that would be implemented in case of fire outbreaks in the campus. Educare has planned an evacuation plan not only in case of fire, but also for earthquakes. <br>
			<br>We also conduct dry run and simulations following the evacuation plan. This is to asses if the plan is properly followed and executed, to know what are the flaws in the plan, what can be improved in the plan, and what could be a better alternate for the action plan. With the help of some Bureau of Fire Protection Baguio personnel, a yearly simulation is successful.<br>

			<br><b>Buwan ng Wika</b> - this is a special celebration that would remind us of our roots as Filipinos. Since Educare is an International school, there are students with different nationalities such as Koreans and Americans. The highlight of this event would be the dancing of students that are part of the indigenous people group. They would be wearing their traditional clothing together with their instruments, namely gongs and other percussion instruments.<br>
			<br>As for the other ethnicities, they would also present their homeland by wearing their traditional clothing for a specific day. They would also deliver speeches or songs in their mother tongue. They would also showcase their cultural beliefs, traditions, and practices. The same goes with the international students.<br>
			<br><hr>
		
			<br><b>Korean Festival</b> - this is one of the most unique events that are taking place in Educare every year. Since a part of the school are rented by Korean students, they are a community of around a hundred of them acquainted with the school owner. This is a week-long event where the Korean students and adults will showcase their talents.<br>
			<br>Not only they will showcase their talents, they also ask representatives from the Filipino students of Educare to perform with them. It is a very enthusiastic event that is usually held at SM Baguio or Malcolm Square. This includes performances of musical bands, dancers, singers, and dramatic plays.<br>
			<br><hr>
				
			<br><b>UN Celebration</b> - This is a common celebration among schools in the Philippines. It's an event where students take a pick of their choice out of all the countries in the world, then they will wear that particular country's traditional clothing. In Educare, we do exactly the same but with a twist. The students are tasked to prepare a phrase in that country's language, then introduce themselves and that country using that language. It can be likened to a simple modeling where students showcase their different outfits.<br>
			<br><hr>
		
			<br><b>Indigenous People's Month</b> - this event is focused on the indigenous people of the Philippines. Since we are here in Baguio, there are a lot of indigenous tribes that reside in the area. In this event, the students are asked to wear the full clothing of any indigenous tribes in the Philippines. This is to give respect and recognition to the lives of indigenous people.<br>
			<br><hr>
		
			<br><b>Educare Sports Festival</b> - this event is one of the most awaited events in Educare. Sports festival is likened to intramurals in other schools. It is just like any other typical intramurals event in other schools, but with a twist. Not only that students get to compete in sports, they can also participate in Filipino traditional games.<br>
			<br>This is a competition among teams. students in different grade levels are grouped equally in four teams and is led by a chosen team leader. Points will be given to each team according to the ranking of how they finished the game. Accumulation of points are going to be done in order to determine the champion.<br>
			<br>The main events of the competition would be the cheering competition and the pageant. These two events are the ones that can bring the team to win because of the number of points given. However, it doesn't guarantee that the team will win if they won both of these events. It will still depend on the points garnered from the minor events.<br>
